            <p>Let me start by saying that I never aspired to climb Kilimanjaro, but, like most adventures, it all began with an semi-serious suggestion from a friend. I’d been trying to plan a trip to Africa over the summer, but I was looking into more typical vacation (read: relaxing) activities like hanging out on a beach in Zanzibar when my friend suggested Kilimanjaro. She’d be in Arusha, Tanzania for a conference in July and, since I had no idea what I was really getting into, I agreed that climbing Kilimanjaro sounded like an exciting, fun vacation. So, I booked my tickets and started some research on <b>the highest peak in Africa.</b></p>

            <h2 class="section-heading">That "Oh Shit" Moment</h2>

            <p>If you do some quick googling on Kilimanjaro you’ll find a trove of information about the perils of undertaking the climb. As a former college athlete, I still pride myself in my (steadily diminishing) level of cardiovascular endurance. However, after a few articles about the physical demands of the trek (not to mention the risk of acute mountain sickness) I knew I was in deep shit. So over the next few months I stepped up my cardio regimen from “almost never” to “weekend warrior.” If I couldn’t get out and hike somewhere near San Francisco, then I’d take long walks in city, praying that the hills between my apartment and the grocery store would help me build enough endurance to take me to the summit. By the time I left for Kilimanjaro I was feeling marginally better about my level of preparation. Equipped with my duffle bag full of hiking gear and altitude medication I set off on the 30-hour journey to Tanzania.</p>
            
            <p>By the time I arrived at Kilimanjaro International Airport (by way of Munich, Cairo, and Addis Ababa) I was in desperate need of a change of clothes and a nap. Unfortunately my bag decided to spend a little extra time exploring the Addis Ababa airport, so cleanliness would have to wait (this would not be the last time). I filed a lost-baggage claim that I was only about 50% sure would be resolved within the two weeks I would spend in Tanzania and got in the cab to Arusha. As the driver headed toward town I immediately spotted the huge mountain ahead of us. Before I could ask, he pointed to the hulking shape and said “that’s Meru,” then, gesturing to the review mirror at a mountain at least 1000m higher “that’s Kili.”</p>

            <h2 class="section-heading">Hakuna Matata</h2>

            <p>Having finally arrived in Arusha, my intended agenda was to join a safari for the next two days, take a rest day, then start the trek. In case it’s not already apparent, I’m not much of a planner, though. However, the next few days went surprisingly well given that I arrived in Tanzania without prearranging anything. Within the next day I managed to book a safari, my friend arranged the trek, and I got word that my bag had miraculously reappeared in Kilimanjaro. So, in the words of my safari guide “Hakuna Matata.” - for those of you who don’t remember “The Lion King,” that means “no worries.”</p>
            
            <h2 class="section-heading">I Have Some Matatas</h2>
            
            <p>When I made it back from the safari, it was time to head to Moshi and make the final preparations for the trek. We took the bus from Arusha to Moshi, a journey of fifty miles, which, in Tanzania means four hours of people sweating on each other. When we finally arrived, our tour guides, Peter and Roman, met us at our hostel to give us the rundown on our 7-day trek to Uhuru peak via the Machame route. I’ve climbed mountains before, including the highest peak in Germany, The Zugspitze (which stands at a paltry 9,718′), but Kilimanjaro was more than double that (19,341’). We’d be scaling the equivalent of the Zugspitze on the first day- every day after that I would literally be reaching new heights. After sharing this information with our guides, they double checked that we had the proper gear and plenty of altitude medication, and somewhat more concerned, made plans to take us to the Machame gate the following morning.</p>
            
            <p>When we arrived at the gate it was drizzling and overcast. We got out of the van to join the small huddles of trekkers gathering around the registration office. Registration took at least an hour, during which my friend and I began to size up the the other groups. Most appeared to be extremely prepared with the latest technical gear and physiques honed by years of Alpinism. We, on the other hand, had a much scrappier flair- sporting worn-in gear from the REI clearance rack and somewhat softer “I-work-at a-desk-job” builds. We’d already paid our guide fee, though, so, ever more worried, we finished our registration and headed to the start of the route.</p>
            
            <h2 class="section-heading">A Long Walk</h2>
            
            <p>I’d be lying if I said climbing Kilimanjaro was a riveting experience. There is only so much enthusiasm one can muster for five straight days of slow walking. The pace did, however, offer plenty of time to appreciate our exotic surroundings on the world’s largest free-standing mountain. As we inched along the path (pole, pole, or ‘slow, slow’ in Swahili) we passed through rainforest, bush- and moorland, and alpine desert. The panoramic views of the mountain around us were breathtaking (as was the lack of atmosphere), but most of the time we fell into a sort of meditative trance watching the path pass one footstep at a time.</p>
            
            <p>We cruised through the first five days- making quiet, steady progress- interrupted only for hydration, snack, and/or altitude medication breaks. By the time we reached Barafu Camp the night before the summit climb I was feeling quite pleased that the trek so far had been uneventful. We made camp, had some dinner, then met our guides for the final debrief before the last leg to the summit.</p>
            
			<h2 class="section-heading">"I'm Never Doing This Again"</h2>
			
			<p>The summit climb would begin at midnight so that we could make it to the peak to see the sunrise. I knew this would be the most challenging leg of the journey for several reasons:</p>
			
			<ol>
				<li>I love sleep, and waking up in the middle of the night to climb a mountain, even if it is Kilimanjaro, is not something I generally want to do.</li>
				<li>It’s cold. It’s really cold at 16,000’ in the dead of night.</li>
				<li>There really isn’t that much air up there. The trek so far had gone better than expected, but I could tell I was already experiencing some light-headedness and that it was definitely not going to get any better.</li>
				<li>This was the steepest and slowest stretch of the entire trek, gaining 3000’ of elevation over just five miles. This leg would take six to seven hours of effort if we didn’t have to make extra stops.</li>
			</ol>
			
			<p>That evening, as I laid in the tent futilely trying to get as much precious sleep as I could, I contemplated the very real possibility that I could die on this mountain.</p>

			<p>Midnight arrived far too quickly and we emerged from our tent into the cold, moonless night wearing our headlamps and almost every article of clothing we’d packed for the week. Drowsily, we began the final ascent. It was impossible to tell where the mountain ended and the sky began in the darkness. We could only see where the trail went by the glow of the headlamps bobbing ahead of us, higher and higher, up into the abyss. With each switchback I checked if I could still see the headlamps above us, knowing that once those lights disappeared over the crest, the summit was within reach.</p>
			
			<p>But, after what seemed like an eternity, it felt as if we were making no progress- I guessed by the furthest headlamp in view that we still had another 1000’ of climbing, probably more. I could feel myself slowing down. My eyes were heavy, my head was swimming, and my footsteps became more of a shuffle. I was losing momentum and there was no end to this hill or to this night in sight. Eventually, I had to ask our guides to stop. I was stumbling, out of breath, and numb with cold. I knew I was toeing the edge of my physical limits, and pushing further at this point might be disastrous. As I sat there for a moment to catch my breath, have some water, and take a few more altitude pills, I honestly wondered if I was dying. I thought to myself, “well, live or die, I’m never doing this again.”</p>
			
			<p>I’d love to call this next bit an inspirational story about perseverance and overcoming self-doubt, but to be completely honest, it was probably just stubbornness that kept me going. I counted my steps to keep my mind off my misery as I trudged forward glassy-eyed and shivering. I knew we were close when first light began to break through the clouds. As we rounded the corner on the final switchback it was like stepping into another world. In the early morning light the peak glowed reddish-orange like the surface of Mars. The end was in sight and all I could think about was getting to the famous “Uhuru Peak" sign and then getting back to camp as quickly as possible. </p>
			
			<h2 class="section-heading">Above It All</h2>
			
			<p>We arranged ourselves in front of the sign and tried look casually nonchalant for our photo. My brain and lungs screamed for air and I was pretty sure I’d gotten a little frostbite on my nose, but somehow I managed to appear happy and relaxed for a few moments. </p>

            <span class="caption text-muted">Here we are at Uhuru Peak, the highest point on the African continent. Thankfully, this is not close enough to see the snot frozen to my face.</span>
            
            <p>All around us were views like I’d never seen before: a Martian landscape of rock and ice floating above the clouds. I took a few photos, but mostly I stood and admired the vastness around me. I felt far away from everything: my work, my friends and family, oxygen. I couldn’t help but feel like my whole world was in perspective, dwarfed by the size of this mountain. I’d never felt smaller in my life.</p>
            
            <p>I could only endure the altitude and cold for about ten minutes before I decided it was time to get back to camp (and my sleeping bag). We made our way back to base camp where the rest of team was waiting with snacks and mango juice. We cheered our successful summit, then I laid down for one of the best naps in the history of humankind.</p>
            
            <h2 class="section-heading">Back to Earth</h2>
            
            <p>Over the next day and a half we descended the entirety of Kilimanjaro to the Mweka gate. As we hiked triumphantly back toward civilization I fantasized about a hot shower and real bed. But, no matter how excited I was to bathe and sleep, I was still sad to see Kilimanjaro getting further and further away.</p>
            
            <p>From the start of the trek I was waiting for Kilimanjaro to put me in my place. What I didn’t anticipate, though, was the number of ways I would be humbled throughout the experience. At the end of the day, it didn’t take extraordinary fitness or resolve to take me to places I’d never been before. All I had to do was keep going forward, one step at a time.</p>
